# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was built to familiarize myself with the tools I will need to succeed in my upcoming bootcamp. It was a good introduction and practice on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It keeps a few of my notes on those topics ready and available for me to look back on anytime I need them in the future.
